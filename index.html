<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Jha'mira, but I go by Jay-Jay or Jay because it's easier to say. I like cats, my lizard, frogs, and Pinterest, as well as drawing and Grow A Garden, the Roblox game that became popular back in April. I also love Colt, the Switch game, Undertale, and Stardew Valley. I spend most of my day at school and then at home with my family</p>
